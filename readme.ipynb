    "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. \n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).\n",

    "When writing this in April 2021, it has been over a year since the pandemic was formally announced. While there are still unknowns regarding COVID-19, we are much more familiar than in the beginning. So much more that a few vaccines have been created and released. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the cycle of unknowns continues because we do not know how long these vaccines will protect us, but many are hopeful that it will return the world to some semblance of normalcy. \n",
    "\n",
    "While looking at the statistics for one's own country is important, others may be concerned about the global economy and wonder when international travel and trade will resume unencumbered. **Herd immunity** has been tossed around as the goal post for when we can move about the way we used to. _Herd immunity_ is resistance to the spread of infectious disease based on the immunity of a high proportion of individuals being exposed to the disease or vaccinated. The percent of people that need to be exposed or vaccinated differs from expert to expert, but most fall within the 70-80% range.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to look at the data on worldwide vaccinations. It will look at the progress that has been made, which countries are ahead and which are not. In addition,this project contains an analysis of COVID-19 vaccine sentiments collected from Twitter. Lastly, it looks at when the world might reach 70% herd immunity based on the data available for fully vaccinated people."
