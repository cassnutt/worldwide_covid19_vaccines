    "Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.\n",

    "The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. \n",

Herd immunity is resistance to the spread of infectious disease based on the immunity of a high proportion of individuals being exposed to the disease or vaccinated. The percent of people that need to be exposed or vaccinated differs from expert to expert, but most fall within the 70-80% range.\n",

Lastly, it looks at when the world might reach 70% herd immunity based on the data available for fully vaccinated people."
